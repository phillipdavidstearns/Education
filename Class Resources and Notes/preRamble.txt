It's complicated...

Building a world view?
In our world, or situation (state) if there is one at all, there are things, or objects. Is that all or is this enough?
These objects possess properties and have the capacity to form relationships with other objects.
A property may determine whether particular relationships are possible.
These objects may be either irreducible or composite, consisting of other objects and their relationships.
Relationships between objects result from their properties, are emergent.
Properties of objects may be intrinsic or emergent, resulting from the relationships between its constituent objects.
Is it possible for properties to be objects?
Is it possible for relationships to be objects?
Relationships cannot exist without objects, at least two.
Relationships are emergent and composite objects.
Relationships my take place between any object so long as their properties permit.
Relationships are the pathways through which interaction between objects occurs.
A thing with no relationships, is simply lonely.
A thing with no properties? Is it anything at all?

Is it possible to redefine our situation so as to eliminate hierarchy?

Materials are collections of objects properties.
