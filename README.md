##SFPC Nested Abstractions - Fall 2016

Instructor: [Phillip David Stearns](http://phillipstearns.com)
Class at [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io), Fall 2016.

"Nested Abstractions" is a class covering a range of nested material and functional abstractions embodied in physical circuits.

Students will be presented material on basic electrical theory, electronic circuits, passive and active electronic components, fabrication and prototyping techniques, and digital logic. Electronic theory will include introductions to the physics of electricity, charge and electro-magnetic forces. Basic materials, units and symbolic representation of electronic circuits will be presented. Basic electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes and transistors will be introduced. The students then construct basic circuits using the P++CB system before moving to the breadboard for more complex circuits. Digital logic will be introduced at the transistor level and will transition to CMOS 4000 series logic devices for more complex functions. Students will explore logic as a musical medium through the construction of breadboarded CMOS 4000 logic based synthesizers. Music synthesis will be used as a way of teaching the inner workings of some fundamental building blocks of computer systems.

This class merges the material and techniqes of [P++CB](https://phillipstearns.wordpress.com/pcb/) and [PureDatrocessarduinoMOS](https://vimeo.com/97899618)
